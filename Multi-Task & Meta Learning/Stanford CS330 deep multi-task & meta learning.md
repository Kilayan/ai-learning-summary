### Lecture 1 What is Multi-Task Learning?

1. Problem Statement
   * learning one task in one environment, starting from scratch using detailed supervision.  -> It takes lots of human effort to learn one small action. And it requires human effort to learn another small action.  -> The ideal way to solve it is that the system is not trained on the single task, but many different tasks. 
   * This can happen at object detection, speech recognition, machine translation, robot reinforcement learning.
