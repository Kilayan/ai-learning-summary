# Generative AI on AWS 

6/2/2023 (Friday)

**Description**

Generative AI is revolutionizing the way we think about content creation. It leverages large models known as *Foundation Models* (FMs), which have been pre-trained on massive datasets. These FMs serve as the backbone for generating fresh and new imaginative content.

In this talk, we'll delve into the principles, techniques, and real-world applications of Generative AI. Weâ€™ll tee it up with a very exciting demo on Chatbot application using *Retrieval Augmented Generation* (RAG)

- Introduction to Generative AI: The what and the why
- Tuning Generative AI models (Prompt Engineering, Fine-Tuning)
- Hosting LLMs on Amazon SageMaker
- ***Demo***: *Retrieval Augmented Generation*(RAG) Chatbot application
