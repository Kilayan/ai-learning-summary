* Kinematics deals with the study of motion of robots without considering the forces that cause that motion. It helps robotics engineers understand how robots move and design them with specific types of movements such as linear or rotational motions. Kinematic analysis plays an important role in enabling precise control of surgical robots.
* Kinematics is divided into two main categories; 
  * **Forward kinematics** involves calculating the position and orientation of an end-effector, such as a gripper given joint angles. 
    * One example of forward kinematics is in 3D printing where a robotic arm with an extruder moves along a predetermined path to deposit layers of material and build an object. 
    * Forward kinematics is used to calculate the position of the extruder at each point along the path based on the joint angles of the robot arm. This ensures that each layer is deposited in exactly the right location.
  * **Inverse kinematics** involves determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation. 
    * An example of robotic applications using inverse kinematics is in the field of medical robotics specifically for surgical procedures. 
    * For instance, the da Vinci surgical system controls the movements of its robotic arms during surgeries. The surgeon sits at the console and controls the movements of the instruments using hand and foot controls. The da Vinci system's inverse kinematic model calculates the joint angles required to move each instrument to a desired position inside the patient's body based on input from the surgeon's controls. 
    * The system also compensates for any movement or tremors in the surgeon's hands to ensure precise movements during delicate procedures.
