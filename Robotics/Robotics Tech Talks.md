# Managing Autonomous Fleets: From Ride-Hailing to Modern Fulfillment Centers

  * Work on transportation and logistics problems 

Abstract: In this talk, I will introduce an array of key models that manage fleet size and guide fleet operations, and discuss how they are used in practice. These models are simple but capture some of the fundamental tensions in fleet management. I will focus on my prior experience in fleet management for modern ride-sharing platforms, and also discuss some on-going work on managing autonomous fleet in modern fulfillment centers based on a UW-Amazon Science grant.

In the warehouse, the efficiency = the time on trip/the total time

How does the driver density influences the pickup time? -> interesting point.

You never operate your system in the danger zone. 

There is always a buffer of the drive to be maintained to serve the urgent request.

The goal is not about efficiency for using surge multiplier. The key goal is to increase the trip completion rate, meaning to encourage drives to complete the trip. 

In Warehouse, what is the optimal number of robots?
